                    <p>I was born in New York state and moved to Philly in 1983. My first computer was a 128k
                        Mac
                        which
                        my
                        father brought home from work that year. I have always been interested in computers and
                        electronics
                        and the tools involved. I always want to know how things work behind the scenes.</p>
                    <p>I am very much into all genres of music. I am mostly interested in instrumental music
                        like
                        jam
                        bands
                        and jazz. I play guitar, drums, keyboards and a little bass but mostly I play guitar. I
                        like
                        to
                        learn how to play classics as well as create my own songs.</p>
                    <p>I am very excited to learn and work with new technologies such as NodeJS and React. I
                        like to
                        learn new languages, frameworks and design patterns. </p>
                    <p>I am also a huge fan of comedy. In fact my favorite movies are comedies. Other genres
                        include
                        movies about real history or biographies of famous people. My favorite comediennes are
                        Larry
                        David, Dave Chappelle, Chris Rock, Jerry Seinfeld, Louis C.K.</p>
